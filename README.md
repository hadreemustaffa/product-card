## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There are some HTML tags and CSS properties that I never used before or have forgotten:

1. <picture> tag, which is used for changing image at different breakpoints.

```html
<picture>
	<!-- an image is set here at a breakpoint -->
	<source media="" srcset="" />
	<!-- default image to display -->
	<img src="" alt="" />
</picture>
```

2. 'flex-basis' - width set for all flex items in a flex container.

### Continued development

For next challenge, these are the concepts to be familiar with:

- Media queries
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML tags
- Folder structures

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This site offers everything to understand/recap the basics.
- [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) - I learned a bit about web accessibility in this site, which I will continue to learn more. There's plenty of information here.
- [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/01/modern-fluid-typography-css-clamp/) - This post helps me understand how to calculate clamp() values for CSS fluid typography.
